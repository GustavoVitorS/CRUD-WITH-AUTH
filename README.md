# Crud with user authentication 📙 ✔️
> V01-19/08/2023
#
> [!NOTE]
>The project is in its first version, although the functional concepts of crud and authentication are working. Still a lot to update, improve and fix.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>As the project is in its initial version, it is not recommended to use it if it is not for academic purposes or to improve knowledge. For it to work it is recommended to use the database of your choice.

> [!WARNING]
> On the user registration screen, the password creation part needs to be more 'rigorous'. Because you can create an account with the password being '1','2','3','4'. This will be fixed in future versions.
