# Crud with user authentication 📙 ✔️
> V01-19/08/2023

> V02-03/09/2023
#
> [!NOTE]
>The project is in its second version, although the functional concepts of crud and authentication are working. There's still a lot to update, improve and fix.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>On the user registration screen, the password creation part has been updated and now the user must create an account with an email and a password with at least 8 characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and a special character.

> [!WARNING]
> As the project is in its development version, it is not recommended to use it if it is not for academic purposes or to improve knowledge. For it to work, it is recommended to use the database of your choice.
